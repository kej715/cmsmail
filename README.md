# cmsmail
BITNet-like email utilities for VM/CMS and RSCS.

These utilities, implemented in REXX, reproduce the email experience that users of VM/CMS had on BITNet during the 1980's. The MAIL utility provides a simple user interface for sending and managing personal email, the SENDFILE utility enables users to encode files in NETDATA format and send them to other users (e.g., users of other machines connected to HNET), and the RECEIVE utility enables users to decode NETDATA files received from other users.

This package is intended to be installed on hobbyist computer systems such as VM370CE running on the Hercules IBM 370 emulator.
